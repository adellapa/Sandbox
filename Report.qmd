```{r}
penguin_bill_length_by_island_and_sex <- penguins |> 
       drop_na(sex) |> 
       group_by(island, sex) |> 
       summarize(mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm))
```

```{r}

            mapping = aes(x = island,
                          y = mean_bill_length,
                          fill = sex)) +
